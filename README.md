#### Description
This is my final week based challenge from my bootcamp. I have created my first app to highlight the hard fought achievements of this bootcamp! Please take the time to check out my website to see my current portfolio and highlights to my current technical experience!

Using react and more importantly setting up components that utilize useState we can tie all the knowledge we've gained thus far to make a clean, and interactive space to display several projects and technologies I've learned in the last 6 months.
